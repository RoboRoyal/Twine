Twine offers control flow statments

1. if/else if/ else  statments
If statments work the same way as they do in most languages

if true{
print("this will print")
}

if false{
print("This will not print")
}


2. else
print("this will print")
if 1>2{
print("2 is greater then 1")
}else{
print("1 is greater then 2")
}


3. else if

if 5 < 2{
print("5 is less then 2")
}else if 5 < 8{
print("5 is between 2 and 8")
}else{
print("5 is greater then 8")
}
